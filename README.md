# [AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns](https://github.com/chenpota/c-sharp/tree/master/AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns)
There are three asynchronous programming patterns in C#: Asynchronous Programming Model (APM), Event-based Programming Model (EPM), and Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).  

* [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](https://github.com/chenpota/c-sharp/tree/master/AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns/AsynchronousProgrammingModel)  
wait-until-done, polling, callback
* [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAM)](https://github.com/chenpota/c-sharp/tree/master/AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns/EventBasedAsynchronousPattern)  
wait-until-done, callback
* [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](https://github.com/chenpota/c-sharp/tree/master/AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns/TaskBasedAsynchronousPattern)  
wait-until-done, polling, callback
