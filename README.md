Implement and record something using C#

# [AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns](https://github.com/chenpota/c-sharp/tree/master/AsynchronousProgrammingPatterns)
There are three asynchronous programming patterns in C#: Asynchronous Programming Model (APM), Event-based Programming Model (EPM), and Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).  
We implemented wait-until-done, polling, and callback, to illustrate APM, EPM, and TAP.
